# lumux gate: every overflow utility is a decision somebody wrote down.
# Parameterized by `lumux-gates.json` in the current directory (or `$LUMUX_GATES`).
#
# The defect: a container inside a fixed-height shell gets its own
# `overflow-y-auto`, and whatever does not fit is in the DOM, unreachable, with
# no scrollbar to hint that anything is below. Three control groups once read
# as "deleted" to an operator; an audit of i18n keys said nothing was missing,
# because nothing WAS missing. Presence audits cannot see this; only layout can.
#
# So: any overflow utility on a scanned surface needs `scroll-ok: <why>` on the
# same line or within the three lines above it. Legitimate uses exist (a
# horizontal strip whose partial last card IS the affordance; a frame clipping
# a video; the one body scroller of a dialog). The gate stops the accidental
# one.
#
# Blind spot: it reads class strings, so `style={{ overflow: "hidden" }}` walks
# past it. The e2e harness measures layout, which is what catches that.
#
# Config key: `scrollRoots` (falls back to `src` + `ui`).
